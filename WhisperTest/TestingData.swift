    What's a Markov matrix?
    Can I just write down a typical Markov matrix, say .1, .2, .7, .01, .99 0, let's say, .3, .3, .4. Okay. There's a -- a
    totally just invented Markov matrix. What makes it a Markov matrix?
    Two properties that this -- this matrix has.
    So two properties are -- one, every entry is greater equal zero.
    All entries greater than or equal to zero.
    And, of course, when I square the matrix, the entries will still be greater/equal zero.
    I'm going to be interested in the powers of this matrix.
